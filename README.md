## Install

### PrePrerequisites

Install the latest version of nvm and npm

    git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git

Move somewhere where you like it. E.g., ~/.nvm

Put into your bashrc:

    export NVM_DIR="/home/sorge/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" "--no-use"  # This loads nvm

    nvm use --delete-prefix stable --silent

Then install the latest version of node (or iojs):

    nvm install stable



### Prerequisites

You need to have a recent installation of NodeJS and npm. Then do

    npm install speech-rule-engine
    npm install mathjax-node
    
You need the js-comint package installed for Emacs and loaded, as well as the
inferior-js program set. For example put into your .emacs file:

    (require 'js-comint)
    (setq inferior-js-program-command "node")

## NVM Dances On Ubuntu 
  
The nvm installed by apt-get on Ubuntu (Node Version Manager) is out
of date.
here are the dances I had to do to get it updated and using the
right version.
  
    # .nvm holds git clone of 
    # https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git
    export NVM_DIR=/home/raman/.nvm
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" "--no-use" Â 
    nvm install stable 
    nvm use --delete-prefix stable --silent
