;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:

;;; Spoken mathematics on the emacspeak audio desktop.
;;; Use a NodeJS based speech-rule-engine for Mathematics as the backend
;;; for processing mathematical markup.
;;; The result of this processing is an annotated S-expression that is rendered via Emacspeak's speech  facilities.
;;; Annotations  follow Aural CSS as implemented in Emacspeak,
;;; This allows us to map these expressions to aural properties supported by specific TTS engines.
;;; Basic Usage:
;;; Startup up the server/client:
;;; M-x emacspeak-maths-start.
;;; Once the server and client are started,
;;; you can browse any number of math expressions using the emacspeak-maths-navigator described below.
;;;
;;; Invoke the Navigator using s-spc  --- this is the <windows> key on Linux.
;;; Now you can use these keys:
;;;@itemize
;;; @item Enter: <SPC> Enter a LaTeX expression.
;;; @item Alt-Text <a> Process alt-text under point as LaTeX.
;;; @item Down <down> Move down a level.
;;; @item Up <up> Move up a level.
;;; @item Left <left> Move left.
;;; @item Right <right> Move right.
;;; @item Exit <any other key> Exit navigator.
;;;@end itemize 
;;; The current expression is spoken after each of the above commands.
;;; It is also displayed in a special buffer *Spoken Math*.
;;; That buffer holds all previously generated output,
;;; And Emacs commands forward-page  and backward-page can be used to move through each chunk of output.

;;; Code:
